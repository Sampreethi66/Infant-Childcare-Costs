Socioeconomic Determinants of Infant Childcare Costs – A Panel Data Approach
This project investigates how median household income and female labor force participation rate (FLFPR) affect the cost of center-based infant childcare across U.S. states from 2008 to 2018. Using a panel dataset from the U.S. Department of Labor's National Database of Childcare Prices (NDCP) and ACS Census data, we apply advanced econometric techniques including:
1.Fixed Effects Regression (State & Year)
2. Log transformation of skewed variables
3. Hypothesis testing and robust standard errors
4. Visualization of regional and temporal trends
Key Contributions
Quantified how rising income and women’s workforce participation impact childcare affordability.
Identified high-cost regions for targeted subsidy recommendations.
Interpreted elasticity-based results to inform public policy.
Technologies & Tools
Python (Pandas, Statsmodels, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
Econometrics (FE models, log-linear transformations)
Data: NDCP, ACS Census, BLS
