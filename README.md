Socioeconomic Determinants of Infant Childcare Costs in the U.S.
Analyzing panel data to uncover what drives childcare prices across states and time

📘 Overview
This project investigates the impact of Median Household Income (MHI) and Female Labor Force Participation Rate (FLFPR) on center-based infant childcare costs in the United States between 2008 and 2018. Using a panel data regression framework, we aim to uncover meaningful socioeconomic patterns that help inform future policy on childcare affordability.

📊 Objectives
Quantify the influence of income and labor participation on childcare costs.

Control for state-level and year-specific effects using fixed effects models.

Evaluate whether higher income and FLFPR are associated with higher childcare expenses.

Visualize regional disparities in costs and socioeconomic drivers.

🧰 Tools & Technologies
Python: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels

Panel Data Regression: Fixed Effects (FE), Log Transformations

Datasets:

National Database of Childcare Prices (NDCP)

U.S. Census and ACS data on MHI and FLFPR

🧪 Methodology
Cleaned and merged multi-source panel data (state × year).

Applied log transformations to normalize cost and income distributions.

Estimated Fixed Effects (FE) regressions to control for unobserved heterogeneity.

Visualized residual patterns, model fit, and regional deviations.

🗺️ Key Insights
States with higher female labor force participation tend to report higher childcare costs.

Income effects were significant: wealthier states spent more on center-based infant care.

Fixed effects captured meaningful state-specific policy environments.

Results suggest the need for targeted subsidies in high-cost regions.

📈 Results Visualization
Time-series plots and bar charts of cost trends by state.

Heatmaps of cost differentials and regression coefficients.

Elasticity interpretation: A 1% increase in MHI leads to approx. $X increase in costs.
